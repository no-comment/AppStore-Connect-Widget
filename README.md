## What is AppStoreConnect Widget ?

AC Widget allows you to easily view your latest app sales on your Home Screen. Some of its main features are:

- Add multiple accounts and quickly switch between them.
- Choose the currency you want your proceeds to be displayed in.
- Select specific apps you want your data to be displaying

## How does it work ?

AC Widget uses the *AppStoreConnect API*. As soon as you open the app, you will be asked to enter an API Key. An exact guide on how to create a key can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) or in the onboarding section of the app. In order for the baseline features to work, the API key needs `Sales and Reports` access rights. If you want to be able to select specific applications, `Developer` rights are needed.

**No data is shared by the app!** Privacy and security were one of our major concerns and reasons this app was made open source.
